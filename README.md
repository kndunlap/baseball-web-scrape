# baseball-web-scrape
This repository is home to the code that will scrape baseball stats from bbref and ESPN, and then allow you to make lots of plots of your choice. Since fangraphs and some of bbref are so hard to scrape, I don't have a lot of advanced stats. Working on it though!
In order to comply with bbref's web scraping policy, I have not made a package, which would be a "tool".
